To make this a static site
You would have to put this under the pages | articles folder and name it [...slug].astro
// This is what you would do if you had a static site
import MainLayout from "../../layouts/MainLayout.astro";
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
import type { CollectionEntry } from "astro:content";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const allBlogArticles: CollectionEntry<"blog">[] =
    await getCollection("blog");
  return allBlogArticles.map((entry) => ({
    params: {
      slug: entry.slug,
    },
    props: { entry },
  }));
}

const { entry } = Astro.props;
